# Task for Arthalfa - Nishant Dixit

## A quick note
Task is completed as was asked. Due to Mumbai Rains that caused no electricity here, it took a bit delay otherwise the task was of hardly 2 hours. I have learned backend from my previous internship at a startup so I have followed all those practices which I was taught :)

**Note** - The server takes some time to spin up again.  So the first request takes longer.

Also, I was wondering if I should have created handler (which interacts with database) as well but as the number of APIs were less and I did't want to increase the number of files, I have added them in the controllers, which is also not a bad practise.

For Routes and Deployed Links - [Doc Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_fIgU-3c6tGIgYON4z8sZJ6Qtiqi_WOI5ASUsEnTU7U/edit?usp=sharing)

What I have used - 
1. bodyparser
2. cors
3. dotenv
4. express
5. expresswinston
6. nodemon
7. pg
8. pghstore
9. sequelize
10. winston

### To have a quick look at all the apis -> Check routes

## Run locally 

Install dependencies

NOTE: You need PostgreSQL DB url in .env

For that you can setup postgresql locally or get a url from render

```
cd backend
```

 ```bash
  npm install
```
```bash
  nodemon server.js
```
